Over the past years, people witnessed record-breaking
wildfires across the world. Some of these fires lasted for weeks and
destroyed multi Billions of dollars of damage as well as several loss of
lifeâ€™s that there are no amounts of Dollars that can replace the loss of families!

What happen if we can spot the fire as early as we can, so we can tremendously reduce the amount of damages.

So we built a solution using React Native, Python Flask, Firebase and Posgresql.

Since the front end is built with react native so its compatible with both ios and android users.

We pulled live satellite data from nasa earth database from which we were able to extract
out potential wildfire locations with abnormal heat emission.

Lets check out our demo to understand this better:

1.  Lets see how many potential wildfire hot spot are out there in the US.
2.  The darker the color represents higher heat emission
3.  Lets tap on one of the circle, a detail of this hot spot pops up
4.  If we click on report fire, the report will be verified with out backend server
5.  If the fire is verified you will see a fire icon on the map accordingly
6.  Traffic route that helps evacuation
